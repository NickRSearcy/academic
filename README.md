    - [x] cites
    - [x] latex
    - [] yaml header
    - [] other stuff?
- [] Generate autocomplete for cites from included `.bib` file (e.g. [LaTeXTools](https://github.com/SublimeText/LaTeXTools]) )
- [] handy snippets
- [] auto list continuation and things like that
- [] add more things to wish list
